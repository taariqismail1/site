description: A review and summary of Adler's How to Read a Book
---

Very few people know how to read books. That’s a pity. Knowing how to read is a skill that completely changes what we can get from a book. At school we learn to read (i.e. understand sentences and paragraphs), but reading a book is much more than that.

Here are some notes from How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading, by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren. As the authors say:

Reading is like skiing. When done well, when done by an expert, both reading and skiing are graceful, harmonious activities. When done by a beginner, both are awkward, frustrating, and slow

I first came across the topic through this talk on the same subject, which I’d also recommend.

## Modernity
__Asad talks about the modern West and its ruthless quest for material progress.__ In the modern world, human virtues are linked to material progress, rather than ethics, which sit uncomfortably in the background. Society has alienated itself from the spiritual and submits only to human comfort. __Asad stresses the point that the West is not Christianity and vice versa.__ The modern West, although borne out of Christianity, is anti-religious.

## An alternative system
An often-repeated question is *"What is the purpose of life?"* According to the Islamic doctrine, the purpose of life is solely to worship God. This worship extends from purely devotional practices to all parts of life, including work, family life, and general societal interactions. __Defining Islam as a *'religion'* is incomplete: a more accurate definition would be a *‘way of life.’*__ To fulfill our purpose, we’re not meant to renounce the world. In fact, we’re meant to embrace it.

## Important areas
Having laid the foundations of the two systems (i.e. the modern West and Islam), Asad mentions a number of areas for the Muslim world to be mindful of as they choose a path forward.

### 1. Education
Education is important because it shapes the leaders of tomorrow. __He encourages the Muslim world to adopt scientific and technical knowledge but to be thoughtful in its application.__ Technical knowledge is *'neither Eastern nor Western,’* so Muslims should take their own philosophy into account when using it. For example, a commercial project to extract resources from the earth should be mindful of __Islam’s concept of stewardship. i.e. that human beings are responsible for the welfare of other human beings, animals, and the environment.__ In Asad’s words:

>Every Muslim has to regard himself as personally responsible for all happenings around him, and to strive to the establishment of right and the abolition of wrong at every time and in every direction

### 2. Imitation
Asad wrote this book in 1934, soon after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the division of the Middle East. Muslims saw the material power and progress of the West and mistook their own weakness for the weakness of Islam. __As Muslims built their newly formed states, he suggested reaching into Islam’s rich heritage instead of blindly imitating the West.__ This reminds me of what Ibn Khaldun, the great sociologist, wrote in the 14th century:

>The vanquished always want to imitate the victor in his distinctive characteristics, his dress, his occupation, and all his other conditions and customs. The reason for this is that the soul always sees perfection in the person who is superior to it and to whom it is subservient. It considers him perfect, either because it is impressed by the respect it has for him, or because it erroneously assumes that its own subservience to him is not due to the nature of defeat but to the perfection of the victor<sup>1</sup>

### 3. Foundations
Apart from a few fundamentals, laws in Islam are based on individual and societal circumstances so are relatively flexible. In addition to laws, there are recommended practices (i.e. the Sunnah) that cover all parts of life. __For situations you’re likely to face in daily life, there’s a host of teachings you can draw upon__ - for example, how to treat guests, how to control your anger, or how to approach business negotiations. Muslims can use these as frameworks to live their lives.

Asad encourages sticking to these practices and talks about the benefits on two levels:

- __Individual__ - doing things systematically encourages people to live consciously and allows for moral accountability - __i.e. you’re aware if your morality is slipping.__ Here’s an analogy: when you’re on a diet you’re more observant of what you’re eating. You also have more moral accountability - if you’ve already had a slice of cake, you know you shouldn’t really have another one.

- __Societal__ - establishing a __common interpersonal framework gives people more clarity and certainty when dealing with others.__ Asad mentions most clashes are due to misunderstandings between people. If everyone is 'on the same page,' you reduce any friction that might occur. Incidentally, ‘all problems are interpersonal problems’ is one of the major premises of another good book, *[The Courage to be Disliked](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Courage-Be-Disliked-yourself-happiness/dp/176063073X/ref=asc_df_176063073X/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310805565966&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6832469819042201549&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045494&hvtargid=pla-546671980543&psc=1)*.

## Approaching another crossroads
Although Islam at the Crossroads was written close to a century ago, it's still relevant today. Some of what Asad imagined did in fact happen, but Muslims are approaching another crossroads.

Three macro trends are playing an important role:

1. __Material progress__ has been instrumental in raising the quality of life around the world, but this has come at a cost. __It’s come at a cost to the environment and society.__ Communities have broken down as life has tended towards individualism. Both Muslims and non-Muslims are now looking for a human-centred idea of life.

2. __Increased consciousness__ in the Muslim world. Muslims are gaining more self-confidence in their rich history and are approaching life and work through this lens.

3. __Decentralisation__ and localisation are empowering people across the world, rather than just in a few major urban centres. The internet and social media are also playing a big role in this: Muslims are producing their own media and can access education aligned with their values. Importantly, it also gives young people role models they can relate to.

*Islam at the Crossroads* is a very interesting, thought-provoking book, but I’d recommend it only after reading a few books on the subject. An excellent starting place is *[The Road to Mecca](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9781887752374?gC=5a105e8b&gclid=CjwKCAjw8cCGBhB6EiwAgORey5MfB9TbP_n-Q3zPaJ-uyhKNyG0NShpQN1J_RDgFQCZkFkgvDynJAhoCRdQQAvD_BwE)*.
