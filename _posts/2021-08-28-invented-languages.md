description: An overview of auxiliary languages, including Esperanto

__Languages are hard to learn.__ You can use some of the tricks outlined in the previous post, but there’s no magic bullet when it comes to learning them - they're *‘irrational, irregular, and uneconomical’*<sup>1</sup>. For example, in English we say *three* dogs. __There's no need for dogs to have an 's' at the end__. Plurality is already implied by *three*, so the *‘s’* redundant.

To make languages easy to learn and speak, __linguists have invented auxiliary languages__ - i.e. languages where the grammar and vocabulary are completely<sup>2</sup> made up. These auxiliary languages remove some of the irrationality and irregularity that have crept into natural languages over the years. __They also have a humanitarian mission__ - a language through which all citizens of the world can communicate. The hope is that a common understanding will reduce conflict and warmongering.

## Esperanto

Esperanto is the most successful auxiliary language, and it’s __the only one that has native speakers__ (i.e. people born into Esperanto households). It was conceived in 1887 by L.L. Zamenhof, a Polish ophthalmologist, to *__‘reduce the time and labour it takes to learn foreign languages, as well as to act as the world's second language.’__* Proponents say you can learn it in just a matter of months<sup>3</sup>. Its grammar is very regular - you can make new words by adding prefixes and suffixes onto a root<sup>4</sup>. Here are some examples<sup>5</sup>.

You can use these to make compound words

This allows someone learning to make up new words, based on words they already know. Its vocabulary is primarily Latin (about 75%), with the remainder from Greek, English, and German.

__Esperanto wasn't the first auxiliary language, nor the last.__ The most recent one, Globasa, is only a couple of years old. Other significant auxiliary languages include Volapuk, Ido, Novia, and Interlingua.

## What’s lost?
Whilst I agree with the diagnosis that languages are irregular, irrational, and uneconomical, __I'm not a pro-auxiliary language. Here's why: language shapes our thought.__ The early auxiliary languages were made using vocabulary from European languages, and even though more recent ones sample vocabulary from a wider range of languages, they naturally don’t capture all the concepts important in each language.

__Conflicts stem from deep-rooted misunderstandings, and they’re often based on cultural and linguistic nuances.__ I’m uneasy about the humanitarian mission: when one group of people doesn’t understand why a certain thing is so important for another group, it’s usually because they don’t have the vocabulary in their own language to conceptualise the issue.

__Modernity's press for standardisation of language loses depth, intricacy, and meaning for so many people.__ I think they won’t be part of the solution leading to world peace. Having said that, learning an auxiliary language can be a good use of time - you can learn a lot about how languages work and [foster strong communities based on these shared interests](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jul/12/weekend.davidnewnham).

2. Actually, they’re usually borrowed from other languages
3. It’s even on Duolingo
4. Other natural languages work in a similar way. Arabic is an example I’m familiar with
