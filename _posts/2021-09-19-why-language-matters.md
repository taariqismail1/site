## Is language declining?

Language has always been important to communicate, but it serves a deeper purpose. It allows us to make sense of the world by categorising things.

“Language is declining” - we hear people (especially academics) complaining about this all the time. Some quotes:

The vocabularies of the majority of high-school pupils are amazingly small. I always try to use simple English, and yet I have talked to classes when quite a minority of the pupils did not comprehend more than half of what I said

From every college in the country goes up the cry, "Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate." Every high school is in disrepair because its pupils are so ignorant of the merest rudiments

If we think language is deteriorating, we should remember this isn’t new. These quotes were actually published more than a hundred years ago (M. W. Smith, 1889 and C. H. Ward, 19171).

This time is different, right? With TV and social media we’ve moved to a visual form of communication, where the little language that’s used is highly simplified. Every generation has thought that language is declining, so are we falling into an exceptionalism trap?



## Esperanto

Esperanto is the most successful auxiliary language, and it’s __the only one that has native speakers__ (i.e. people born into Esperanto households). It was conceived in 1887 by L.L. Zamenhof, a Polish ophthalmologist, to *__‘reduce the time and labour it takes to learn foreign languages, as well as to act as the world's second language.’__* Proponents say you can learn it in just a matter of months<sup>3</sup>. Its grammar is very regular - you can make new words by adding prefixes and suffixes onto a root<sup>4</sup>. Here are some examples<sup>5</sup>.

You can use these to make compound words

This allows someone learning to make up new words, based on words they already know. Its vocabulary is primarily Latin (about 75%), with the remainder from Greek, English, and German.

__Esperanto wasn't the first auxiliary language, nor the last.__ The most recent one, Globasa, is only a couple of years old. Other significant auxiliary languages include Volapuk, Ido, Novia, and Interlingua.

## What’s lost?
Whilst I agree with the diagnosis that languages are irregular, irrational, and uneconomical, __I'm not a pro-auxiliary language. Here's why: language shapes our thought.__ The early auxiliary languages were made using vocabulary from European languages, and even though more recent ones sample vocabulary from a wider range of languages, they naturally don’t capture all the concepts important in each language.

__Conflicts stem from deep-rooted misunderstandings, and they’re often based on cultural and linguistic nuances.__ I’m uneasy about the humanitarian mission: when one group of people doesn’t understand why a certain thing is so important for another group, it’s usually because they don’t have the vocabulary in their own language to conceptualise the issue.

__Modernity's press for standardisation of language loses depth, intricacy, and meaning for so many people.__ I think they won’t be part of the solution leading to world peace. Having said that, learning an auxiliary language can be a good use of time - you can learn a lot about how languages work and [foster strong communities based on these shared interests](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jul/12/weekend.davidnewnham).

3. It’s even on Duolingo
4. Other natural languages work in a similar way. Arabic is an example I’m familiar with
