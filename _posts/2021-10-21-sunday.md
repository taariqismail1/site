title: 32. Sunday
subtitle: Raising $124m with a QR code
description: Sunday.com. An overview.

I previously wrote about Boom Supersonic, a startup pushing technology boundaries to make supersonic air travel safe and economical. This week's post is about a different type of startup.

Sunday is a company that allows you to order food at restaurants and pay your bill using a QR code. You don’t need an app, just the internet. They launched only 6 months ago (April 2021), and have since raised $124m over two funding rounds.

Their focus is on reducing friction when paying a restaurant bill. The key marketing message

"Your customers can view the menu and pay the bill in 10 secs".

Arguably they're not doing anything technologically innovative (e.g. building cost-effective supersonic jets), but have raised a lot of money recently and are growing rapidly - and that’s why they’re worth looking into.

Some reflections on a couple of the poems:

## 1. The moving finger writes

*The moving finger writes;\
and, having writ, moves on:\
nor all thy piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line,\
nor all thy tears wash out a word of it*

This poem brings to life the phrase *'what's done is done.'* Once something happens, anything we have at our disposal - whether it’s knowledge or prayers - cannot change the tiniest detail of the past. There's no point crying either - tears, with all their ability to wash ink away, can’t change a single thing about the past.

## 2. Tis all a Chequer-board of nights and days

*Tis all a Chequer-board of nights and days\
Where Destiny with men for Pieces plays:\
Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,\
And one by one back in the closet lays*

I like the imagery of the chequer-board of night and days, with its black and white tiles contrasted against each other. It reduces the complexity of life to the alternation of days and nights, in which we move, and mate, and slay (again, keeping the imagery of chess). The reality is that our ultimate destination is the closet - a place where all pieces must return when the game is over.

## The first edition
Initially, there was __very little traction of FitzGerald's translation:__ 250 copies were printed, and most were sitting around in a bookstore. They were discovered by a poet of the time, Swinburne, who shared it with his friends. The book then went viral, and __became so popular that there were numerous "Omar Khayyam clubs” established in England__ during the late 19th century, where members met to discuss the *Rubaiyat*.

## Some thoughts on authenticity and meaning
Should this be viewed as a work of FitzGerald, rather than of Khayyam? Experts mention the flexibility FitzGerald allowed himself in translating the work, and many believe he mistook Khayyam’s original mystical themes for religious skepticism.

__Nevertheless, removing the baggage of FitzGerald’s interpretation of Khayyam, the rubaiyat paints vivid pictures and can be used as poetry should: to educate, to inspire, and to nourish the soul.__
