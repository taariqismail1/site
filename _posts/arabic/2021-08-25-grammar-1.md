I constantly need to remind myself of the grammar rules when dealing with numbers. Here's my high level summary:

## Numbers 1 and 2
- Gender: Number agrees with noun
- Case: Number agrees with noun
- Note - the number is usually implied through the noun, so you don't have to explicitly mention the number
- كتابٌ (واحدٌ(
- قلمان (إثنان(

## Numbers 3 - 10
- Gender: Number disagrees with noun
- Case: Genitive (*majrūr*), given the number is usually placed in an idāfa (noun following the number)
- Nound is plural
- أربعةُ طلابٍ
- عَشْرُ سياراتٍ
