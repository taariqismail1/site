I've been learning Arabic for a number of years now. I'm documenting what I'm learning to make sure I digest the new vocabulary or concepts I come across. 

This isn't a guide to learning Arabic. You'll benefit if you're already familiar with Arabic and want to pick up on new vocabulary or refresh your understanding of some grammatical concepts. Let me know if this is useful.
