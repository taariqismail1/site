I've been learning Arabic for a number of years now. These are my notes/ what I'm learning at the moment. I'm doing this to ensure my learning is active and that I'm digesting the new vocabulary or concepts I come across. 
This isn't a guide to learning Arabic. You'll benefit if you're already familiar with Arabic and want to pick up on new vocabulary or refresh your understanding of some grammatical concepts. Let me know if this is useful.
