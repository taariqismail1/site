# Welcome
I've decided to create a website. Austin Kleon's book [*Show Your Work*](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work) pushed me over the edge.

# About me
I'm curious about many things - languages, economics, strategy and technology are just a few. I work in strategy consulting and have a strong technical background through an engineering degree and work experience in data science.  

# Blog
I've started writing online to improve my writing and to learn in public. Follow me on <a href="https://taariq.substack.com" target="_blank">Substack</a>. Visit my [Blog page](https://www.taariqismail.com/blog) for a list of posts.
